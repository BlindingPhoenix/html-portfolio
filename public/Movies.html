<hr />
        <h3>The Princess Bride</h3>
            <h4>I love this movie because it was the first comedic romance I had watched as a kid and I had my first crush on a grown movie character, Wesley.</h4>
        <h3>The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</h3>
            <h4>Beautiful imagery and it really makes one feel like it's possible to live in that world.</h4>
        <h3>The Game</h3>
            <h4>This movie was the first suspense brain teaser that I had ever seen and I loved that I couldn't guess what the end was going to be</h4>
